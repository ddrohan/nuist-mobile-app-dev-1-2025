# Adding Logging Support

In Kotlin, as opposed to Java, there is no established standard when it comes to logging. JetBrains didnâ€™t provide any opinionated way. There are few different approaches that allow developers to do it properly but we're going to use [`kotlin-logging`](https://github.com/MicroUtils/kotlin-logging) - a lightweight logging framework for Kotlin, written in Pure Kotlin. It's a convenient and performant logging library wrapping *slf4j* with *Kotlin* extensions.

So first of all, open your `build.gradle.kts` and add the following dependencies (version numbers may differ, so upgrade if prompted) **AND** make sure you 'sync' your gradle file (top right arrow in screenshot)

~~~java
implementation("org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.36")
implementation ("io.github.microutils:kotlin-logging:2.1.23")
~~~

After 'sync' (and the 'Build' Window open)

Note: if you get the following message when importing

Choose **Enable Auto-Import** (will make life a lot easier!)

Next, open your `main.kt` and add the following ***before*** your ***main*** function (and fix any import errors)

~~~kotlin
private val logger = KotlinLogging.logger {}
~~~

and

Now add the following to where you think is most appropriate to achieve the output below

~~~java
 logger.info { "Launching Placemark Console App" }
~~~

Run your app again and you should get something like this

Congratulations - you've just added logging support to your Kotlin project :)
