## Kotlin **`main`** Function

Similar to previous labs, create a new package **`org.setu.placemark.console.main`** inside the `Kotlin` folder and add a new **`Kotlin File`** called **`main`** inside that package

Enter the following code into this new `main` file:

~~~kotlin
fun main(){
    println("Placemark Kotlin App Version 1.0")
}
~~~

Your project should now look something like this
